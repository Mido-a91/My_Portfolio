## 1 - [Used Car Sales](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Mido-a91/Portfolio/blob/master/Used%20Cars%20Sales%20-%20Linear%20Regression.ipynb) - Linear Regression 
* ***Business problem***: Predict used cars prices based on multiple features for buyers.
* Implemented Tableau dashboards to explore Brands, Mileages, Engines, & Models features.
* Incorporated Pandas Data Manipulation Algorithms to create an accurate model.
* Examined OLS assumptions and created a Multiple Linear Regression model using SKlearn.
* Evaluated the model at Test data using R2 score metric with an accuracy of 80%.

## 2 - [The Battle of Neighbourhoods](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Mido-a91/The_Battle_of_Neighborhoods/blob/f71e23e66f3ef01751a8a7233e945f2906f691bd/The_Battle_of_Neighborhoods%20Notebook.ipynb) - K means Clustering and APIs 
* ***Business problem***: Segment downtown Venues within Manhattan VS. Toronto for investors
* Converted New York JSON file to Pandas, and Web Scraped Toronto Neighborhoods data.
* Examined Neighborhoods’ Descriptive Statistics within Manhattan and Downtown Toronto.
* Implemented Foursquare APIs, and retrieved Venues for the desired downtown locations.
* Segmented Venues’ categories using K-means Clustering, and Visualized on Follium Maps.

## 3 - [Video Games Sales](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Mido-a91/Portfolio/blob/master/Video%20Games%20Sales%20Final%20Project%20-%20Linear%20Regression.ipynb)  - Linear Regression 
* ***Business problem***: Understand key features, and predict North America total games’ sales.
* Executed SQL Magic commands in Python to query designated Data from the Database.
* Incorporated Matplotlib and Visualized Genres, Platforms, Publishers & NA Sales features.
* Conducted Correlation analysis & developed Statistical Models including Linear Regression.
* Evaluated the models using MAE & MSE metrics, concluding that Lasso Regression is best fit.

## 4 - AudioBooks Subscriptions - Deep Neural Networks
* Business problem: Classify customers buying new audiobooks, to focus marketing efforts. 
* Balanced, Shuffled and Standardized the Data to avoid Biased Classification in the model. [Preprocessing - Part 1](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Mido-a91/My_Portfolio/blob/master/AudioBooks%20Subscriptions%20-%20Deep%20Neural%20Network/1%20-%20Audiobooks_Preprocessing_with_comments.ipynb)
