# Portfolio - Data Science Personal Projects

## 1 - Used Car Sales - Linear Regression
* ***Business problem***: Predict used cars prices based on multiple features for buyers.
* Implemented Tableau dashboards to explore Brands, Mileages, Engines, & Models features.
* Incorporated Pandas Data Manipulation Algorithms to create an accurate model.
* Examined OLS assumptions and created a Multiple Linear Regression model using SKlearn.
* Evaluated the model at Test data using R2 score metric with an accuracy of 80%.

## 2 - The Battle of Neighbourhoods - K means Clustering and APIs
* ***Business problem***: Segment downtown Venues within Manhattan VS. Toronto for investors
* Converted New York JSON file to Pandas, and Web Scraped Toronto Neighborhoods data.
* Examined Neighborhoods’ Descriptive Statistics within Manhattan and Downtown Toronto.
* Implemented Foursquare APIs, and retrieved Venues for the desired downtown locations.
* Segmented Venues’ categories using K-means Clustering, and Visualized on Follium Maps.

## 3 - Video Games Sales - Linear Regression
* ***Business problem***: Understand key features, and predict North America total games’ sales.
* Executed SQL Magic commands in Python to query designated Data from the Database.
* Incorporated Matplotlib and Visualized Genres, Platforms, Publishers & NA Sales features.
* Conducted Correlation analysis & developed Statistical Models including Linear Regression.
* Evaluated the models using MAE & MSE metrics, concluding that Lasso Regression is best fit.
