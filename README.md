# Portfolio - Data Science Personal Projects

## 1 - Used Car Sales - Linear Regression
1. ***Business problem***: Predict used cars prices based on multiple features for buyers.
2. mplemented Tableau dashboards to explore Brands, Mileages, Engines, & Models features.
3. Incorporated Pandas Data Manipulation Algorithms to create an accurate model.
4. Examined OLS assumptions and created a Multiple Linear Regression model using SKlearn.
5. Evaluated the model at Test data using R2 score metric with an accuracy of 80%.

## 2 - The Battle of Neighbourhoods - K means Clustering and APIs
1. ***Business problem***: Segment downtown Venues within Manhattan VS. Toronto for investors
2. Converted New York JSON file to Pandas, and Web Scraped Toronto Neighborhoods data.
3. Examined Neighborhoods’ Descriptive Statistics within Manhattan and Downtown Toronto.
4. Implemented Foursquare APIs, and retrieved Venues for the desired downtown locations.
5. Segmented Venues’ categories using K-means Clustering, and Visualized on Follium Maps.

## 3 - Video Games Sales - Linear Regression
1. ***Business problem***: Understand key features, and predict North America total games’ sales.
2. Executed SQL Magic commands in Python to query designated Data from the Database.
